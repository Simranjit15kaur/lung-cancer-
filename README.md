# 🫁 Digital Twin for Lung Cancer Detection using E-Nose

## 📌 Project Description
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection significantly improves survival rates; however, traditional diagnostic methods are expensive, invasive, and time-consuming.

This project proposes a **Digital Twin–based Lung Cancer Detection System** using an **Electronic Nose (E-nose)** concept. The system analyzes **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** present in human breath and uses **Machine Learning models** to classify lung cancer presence.

A **digital twin** of the E-nose is created to simulate sensor responses virtually, reducing dependence on physical sensor hardware while enabling scalable experimentation and explainable AI-driven diagnostics.
